Cloud - Infrastructure as a service 

* It gives a IAAS, it gives all we needs

Ex: Story : At the beginning stage Bank  has started a business and told the people to keep you money with us. we will keep safe, all of us laugh and deny at the initial stage.
but later few years all will keep it in bank for security, loans interest and so many features.

      - The same Scenario happens in the Cloud Computing, In 2005, they started a Business to launch but all are deny at when 2015, after 2016 they shared lots of features and attracts all but now cloud ruling 

lets see one point here :

1. once the On-premise people shifted to Cloud - right ?
   - here you note, application changing is possible - frequently.
   - but changing environment is not possible frequently.
